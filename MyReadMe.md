**Overview**

This project utilizes Azure DevOps Pipelines to automate the creation of Docker images and their deployment to a Docker Hub repository. Additionally, it employs Terraform to provision an Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) cluster, which is configured to run applications in a Kubernetes environment. The configuration and state of the Terraform templates are stored in an AWS S3 bucket for remote access and management.
